"""Prints all clusters that are affected by selected rule.

This script can be used to analyze data exported from `report` table by
the following command typed into PSQL console:

    \copy report to 'reports.csv csv

Script displays two tables:
    1. org_id + cluster_name (list of affected clusters)
    2. org_id + number of affected clusters (usually the only information reguired by management)
